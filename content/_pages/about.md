Hi there! My name is Mathias Michel and I am a Software Developer specialized to Mobile and Web Frontend development. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science & Media from Technical University Nuremberg and I am working at [Jambit GmbH]{:target="_blank"} since 2017.

Despite traveling the world and going to the gym I am interested in finance like Stocks, P2P & Cryptocurrencies. I love nice designs and a good UX in products which you can find for example in Apple products.

If you have feedback, questions, or want to contact me? Feel free and [contact me] or find me on Github, StackOverflow, and elsewhere around the web.
