Yeah! Welcome to my first blog post! After a long time of thinking if I should start my own blog and what I which topic should I address, I jumped about this border and set up my new site [mathias.rocks].

The goal of this site will be to get a reputation and to start writing down my thoughts. The topics which I will address will be technical problems or ideas regarding iOS or web development, software architecture and useful tips. Furthermore, I want to improve my English writing skills, therefore, I decided to write some posts especially technical topics in English.

I hope you enjoy reading. :)
